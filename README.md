This repository contains notes on Computer Science topics that I am studying. Each day, I will pick a topic from Computer Science and write about it. These notes are meant to help me solidify my understanding of these concepts and serve as a reference for myself and others who might be interested.

I am aiming to study new topic each day, and also make notes about it here.
